# ByTheWay

This app won't let you miss anything interesting along your trip.

## What for?
ByTheWay helps you plan your trip calculating all the routes and suggesting 
interesting places along the way.

You can easily plan the time of your trip providing departure hour, and 
the hour you want to be back home at the last day. 
App will calculate the route there and back showing you when you will arrive at 
de destination, how much free time you will have there and when you have to leave it.

For both directions of your trip, ByTheWay will suggest up to 20 interesting places
depending on your favorite categories. You can just add the places you want to 
visit, and your routes will be automatically updated and visualized on a map.

All your trips are stored in a database, so you can use them whenever you want by 
adding chosen trip to your calendar.
